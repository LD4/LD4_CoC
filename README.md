# NOTE: THIS DOCUMENT IS A WIP. IT IS NOT CURRENTLY COMPLETE OR APPROVED BY THE LD4 COMMUNITY.

## About & Scope

The LD4 Community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, open, and positive experience for all its participants, in our community spaces online, in-person, formal and informal. The LD4 Community welcomes participation from people all over the world and these participants bring with them a wide variety of professional, personal and social backgrounds; whatever these may be, we treat all LD4 Community participants with dignity and respect.

We therefore strive to express ourselves simply and clearly remembering that unnecessary use of jargon will be a barrier to understanding. We discuss ideas and collaborate from a standpoint of mutual respect and reasoned argument. We work together to promote a respectful, safe, and open community.

To make this happen, we have here some expectations of all participants in the LD4 Community (virtual or in person). Included are:
- Social Rules to support a diverse and inclusive community
- Anti-Harassment Policy (including a Conflict Resolution strategy) to maintain a safe community
- Principles of Openness & Transparency to build an open community

## Social Rules

In order to create an inclusive, safe, and open work environment, we ask that all LD4 Community participants follow a set of rules designed by the the Recurse Center, previously the Hacker School. In their own words, 'the goal [of the Recurse Center Social Rules] isn't to burden everyone with a bunch of annoying rules, or to give us a stick to bludgeon people with for "being bad." Rather, these rules are designed to help all of us build a pleasant, productive, and fearless community.'

As such, these four rules are a lightweight set of explicit social norms to curtail specific kinds of behavior found to be destructive to a supportive, productive, and fun learning/working environment. The four rules are listed here; you can read more about them at http://recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules.

- `"No feigning surprise."` You shouldn't act surprised when someone says they don't know something. There is no benefit to feigning surprise, and regardless of intent, it makes someone feel bad, or worse, about admitting that they don't know something.
- `"No well-actually's."` This is when someone says something almost, but not entirely correct, and another person responds with "well, actually," and gives a correction. That's not to say we don't care about truth or precision, but there are better ways to communicate this.
- `"No back-seat driving."` If you overhear other people working through a problem, don't just intermittently toss advice in without engaging.
- `"No subtle -isms"`. This last rule bans racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias. Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel uncomfortable, and might be familiar as they're under the term "microagressions."

Tip of the hat here also to Mark Matienzo, who wrote the additional text explaining each of these rules in the context of a collaborative environment. We've paraphrased Matienzo's work here.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

The LD4 Community does not tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery (including sexual) is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, or any community channel such as the chatroom or mailing list.

In the event that someoneâ€™s conduct is causing offense or distress, LD4 Community has a Anti-Harassment Policy and Protocol which can be applied to address the problem. The first step in dealing with any serious misconduct is to contact a local meeting organizer, the LD4 Community helpers (email), a community member you trust, or the LD4 Community Directors Group immediately.

Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment.  It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

### Conflict Resolution

1. Initial Incident

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, __and you feel comfortable speaking with the offender__, please inform the offender that he/she/ze/they has affected you negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having that initial discussion.

    The LD4 Community recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to unfamiliarity with the community, [lack of spoons](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/wpress/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/), and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable speaking directly with the offender for any reason, skip straight to step 2.

2. Escalation

    If the offender insists that he/she/ze/they did not offend, if offender is actively harassing you, or if direct engagement is not a good option for you at this time, then you will need a third party to step in.

    If you are at a conference or other event, find the event organizer or staff person, who should be listed [on the wiki](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Main_Page). If you can't find the event organizer, there will be other staff available to help if the situation calls for immediate action.

    If you are in the LD4 Slack, use the #helpers channel to find someone who can help. There is at least one helper monitoring the channel at most times, there is a pinned list of helpers and their emails on the channel (updated as needed), and invoking @channel will notify everyone in the #helpers channel of your message.

3. Wider community response to Incident:

    If the incident doesn't pass the first step (discussion reveals offense was unintentional, apologies said, public note or community is informed of resolution), then there's not much the community can do at this point
    since the incident was resolved without outside intervention.

    If incident results in corrective action, the community should support the decision made by the Help in Step 2 if they choose corrective action, like ending a talk early or banning from the communication channel, as well as support those harmed by the incident, either publicly or privately (whatever individuals are comfortable with).

    If the Help in Step 2 run into issues implementing the CoC, then the Help should come to the community with these issues and the community should revise the CoC as they see fit.

    In Real Life people will have opinions about how the CoC is enforced. People will argue that a particular decision was unfair, and others will say that it didn't go far enough. We can't stop people having opinions, but what we could do here is have constructive discussions that lead to something tangible (affirmation of decision, change in CoC, modify decision, etc,).

### Sanctions

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the LD4 Community communication channel(s) or event.

Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:

* warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in other sanctions;
* requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event (if applicable);
* early termination of a talk that violates the policy;
* not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the policy;
* not allowing a speaker who violated the policy to give (further) talks at the event;
* immediately ending any event volunteer responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds (either indefinitely or for a certain time period);
* requiring that the harasser immediately leave the event, working group, or communication channel and not return;
* publishing an account of the harassment.

Code4Lib event organizers can be identified by their name badges, and will help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.  We expect participants to follow these rules at all LD4 Community venues, conference-related social events, community gatherings, and communication channels.
